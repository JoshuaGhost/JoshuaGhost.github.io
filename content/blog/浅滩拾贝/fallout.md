War. War never changes.

战争，战争亘古未变


The end of the world occurred pretty much as we had predicted. 

世界的终结要远早于我们的预料

Too many humans, not enough space or resources to go around. 

人口爆炸，现有的资源与空间难以容纳如此庞大的人口

The details are trivial and pointless, the reasons, as always, purely human ones.

细节并不重要，而原因，则仅仅是人类自己

The earth was nearly wiped clean of life. 

地球上已经生灵涂炭

A great cleansing, an atomic spark struck by human hands, quickly raged out of control. 

由人类自己创造的核子火花，点燃了末世浩劫的火药桶，很快局势便失去控制

Spears of nuclear fire rained from the skies. 

核子神罚之火从天而降

Continents were swallowed in flames and fell beneath the boiling oceans. 

陆地被烈焰吞噬，沉入怒腾的海水

Humanity was almost extinguished, their spirits becoming part of the background radiation that blanketed the earth.

人类几近灭绝，他们的灵魂变成了地表核冬天的背景辐射

A quiet darkness fell across the planet, lasting many years. 

在很多年之内，黑暗与静默都是这个星球的唯一主题

Few survived the devastation. 

少量人类从大灾变中存活了下来

Some had been fortunate enough to reach safety, taking shelter in great underground vaults. 

有些足够幸运的人躲藏到了足够安全的地下掩体里面

When the great darkness passed, these vaults opened, and their inhabitants emerged to begin their lives again.

黑暗的时期过去以后，避难所打开了大门，居民们又开始了他们的正常生活

One of the northern tribes claims they are descended from one such Vault. 

一个北方的部落宣称他们是这样一个避难所居民的后代

They hold that their founder and ancestor, one known the "Vault Dweller," once saved the world from a great evil.

他们把那曾经把世界从恶魔口中拯救出来的那位避难所居民奉为祖先与奠基者

According to their legend, this evil arose in the far south. 

他们传说中无恶不做的恶魔似乎来自遥远的南方

It corrupted all it touched, twisting men inside, turning them into beasts. 

它让所及之地寸草不生，它蛊惑了人心，把人类变成了畜兽

Only through the bravery of this Vault Dweller was the evil destroyed. 

唯有那始源的避难所居民的勇敢之心才可将这头恶魔燃烧殆尽

But in so doing, he lost many of his friends and suffered greatly, sacrificing much of himself to save the world.

但是在这征途中，他失去了他的许多挚友，历经了许多磨难，牺牲了自己的很多去救世界于水火

When at last he returned to the home he had fought so hard to protect, he was cast out. 

当他重返家乡，却因为战后综合症陷入了过度的自我防御，从而最终被驱逐

Exiled. In confronting that which they feared, he had become something else in their eyes...and no longer their champion.

在放逐途中，他遭遇了无数为世人畏惧的事物，他也在人们眼中变得越来越陌生，他不再是众口铄金的英雄

Forsaken by his people, he strode into the wasteland.

在被他的族人无情抛弃之后，他一头栽进废土

He traveled far to the north, until he came to the great canyons. 

他踏上了向北之旅，最终驻足在大峡谷

There, he founded a small village, Arroyo, where he lived out the rest of his years. 

他在大峡谷发现的一个小小村庄，Arroyo，定居终身

And so, for a generation since its founding, Arroyo has lived in peace, its canyons sheltering it from the outside world. 

自那以后，在小村庄被发现之前很长一段时间，Arroyo都是一个世外桃源——大峡谷将她与世隔绝

It is home. Your home.

这就是家，你的故乡

But the scars left by the war have not yet healed. And the Earth has not forgotten. 

但是战争所造成的同创还远未被治愈，人类自己也没有获得救赎…………

Because of war, war never changes...

因为战争，战争永未改变...
