# [JoshuaGhost.github.io](https://JoshuaGhost.github.io)
This is the repository of my personal web site.
  
Two branches are concluded if no exception. The **master** branch contains the web elements to be shown on the [site](https://JoshuaGhost.github.io), while the **source** branch contains the python code using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) framework, which is a static site generator.

As for the content of my blog, currently only Chinese articles are available. In the future Articles in English/German/Franch/Russia will be (possibly) added. Please don't look forward of it and i've no responsibility for what i didn't promise XD.
